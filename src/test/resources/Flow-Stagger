Flow / Stagger

Stagger - starts with 2 reds and continues until it hits a Flow start point - i.e. (green, green) or (green, red, green), the Stagger
ends on the point before this Flow start point, or is a special case Stagger - i.e. probelog does not complete on a test run i this case all of
file changes that happened after the last test run, or in the case of no test run ever being done - all of the file changes of the probelog.  If this special
case stagger comes after a normal stagger (i.e one that ended in a test run) then they should remain two separate staggers
or - a red followed by just file changes in which case the stagger starts on the red

Flow - Not Stagger

____________

Inside Flow there are

TFP episode - red (with a test code change), green

Refactoring - Not a TFP cycle and not a discord

Note - Flow/Stagger was Harmony/Discord - flow is more about how programmer feels - harmony emphasises the state of the system

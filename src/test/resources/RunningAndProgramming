Eliud Kipchoge 2 hours, me 4 hours but we have one thing in common - cadence 180 steps a minute. Safe cadence for me i could try and go faster but that requires
me to overstride, if you overstride in a race maybe you will finish with a better time, but you wont be up to much afterwards and dont
ask me to run again the next day.

When i program i can manage on average about 3 code line changes at a time, anymore and i mess up, i break the tests, so 3 lines of code is my programming stride length, anymore
and i am probably overstriding - the tests start to break, keep this up and a feeling of dread starts to build, i  feel besieged and out of control - i hit the wall !
Going downhill the stride might open up, while going uphill the stride compacts.

I speculate every programmer has a stride length, some super guys are Kipchoges, in the pack there are a lot like me, but the sad truth is there are a lot of
programmers stressed and besieged and out of control cause every step is a step too far.

So to improve as a programmer i think it would be cool to be able to playback a programming session, and at glance be able to pick out the points where we are
flowing our cadence is consistent, we are eating up the road, and also more importantly to be able to pick out the kinks in our session, the points at which
we were struggling, where the tests stubbornly stayed red for a bit too long.  Maybe we took a wrong turn at this point, we persisted in adding in behaviour
when we should have taken time to refactor, or we missed a trick somehow - a pattern or an idiom, maybe its time to ask for help from a buddy or God forbid go
on that training course.  Maybe there is some systemic flaw in the way in which I code that is hobbling me on every stride, like the weakness in my lower
back makes me drop my left shoulder when i am pushing too hard.

Ok so this is where codeTail comes in - easiest to explain with example....

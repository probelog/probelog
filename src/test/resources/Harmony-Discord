Harmony / Discord

Discord - starts with 2 reds and continues until it hits a harmony start point - i.e. (green, green) or (green, red, green), the discord
point ends on the point before this harmony start point, or is a special case Discord - i.e. probelog does not complete on a test run i this case all of
file changes that happened after the last test run, or in the case of no test run ever being done - all of the file changes of the probelog.  If this special
case discord comes after a normal discord (i.e one that ended in a test run) then they should remain two separate discords
or - a red followed by just file changes in which case the discor starts on the red

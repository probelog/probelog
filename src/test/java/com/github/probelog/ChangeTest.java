    /*

    Decided to to do this before test run logging as these tests
    should ask more fundamental questions
    and nurture the key design elements

    1) Simple Change (i.e. two nearest events for same file.)
       - Update Change
       - Create Change
       - Delete Change
       - No Change (e.g. two deletes, or 2 updates (with same file value))

    2) Episode Change (have to go back beyond a specific start event of "episode")


    3) Aggregate Episode Change - get all the changes fro an episode.

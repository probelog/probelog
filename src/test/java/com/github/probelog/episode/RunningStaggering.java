    Stagger (Test First Programming) - Two or more reds where first red contains a test class change
            (Refactoring) - One or more reds where first red does not contain a test class change

    Will simplify above so dont have to go to bother of checking if test run contains a test class change or not and just have a
    stagger as 2 or more reds

    Stagger ends on a green (so the green is inclusive), unless no greens at end (Abandoned Stagger)

    Run - anything that is not in a stagger
